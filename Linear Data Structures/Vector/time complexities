The time complexity for doing various operations on vectors is-

* Random access – constant O(1)
* Insertion or removal of elements at the end – constant O(1)
* Insertion or removal of elements – linear in the distance to the end of the vector O(N)
* Knowing the size – constant O(1)
* Resizing the vector- Linear O(N)
