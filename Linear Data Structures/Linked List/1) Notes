Basics
* a Linked List is a linear data structure
* inked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location
* the elements are linked using pointers
* series of connected nodes
* each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

Why Linked List over Arrays?
* The size of the arrays is fixed
* Insertion / Deletion of an element in an array of elements is expensive

Advantages of Linked Lists over arrays:
* Dynamic Array
* Ease of Insertion/Deletion

Drawbacks of Linked Lists: 
* It takes a lot of time in traversing and changing the pointers.
* Reverse traversing is not possible in singly linked lists.
* It will be confusing when we work with pointers.
* Direct access to an element is not possible in a linked list 
    (as in an array by index.)
* Searching for an element is costly and requires O(n) time complexity.
* Sorting of linked lists is very complex and costly.
* Random access is not allowed.
* Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list. 
* Not cache-friendly
