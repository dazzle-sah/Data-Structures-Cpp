* a Linked List is a linear data structure
* inked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location
* the elements are linked using pointers
* series of connected nodes
* each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

Why Linked List over Arrays?
* The size of the arrays is fixed
* Insertion / Deletion of an element in an array of elements is expensive
